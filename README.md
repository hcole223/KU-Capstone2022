This project was a degree finder for the University of Kansas written primarily in Node and Express. It featured a survey to recommend degrees based on interests as well as standard degree/certificate/class search functionality. 

The application was hosted in AWS EC2 behind an AWS ALB. GitHub was the primary code repository while the data for the application was hosted in an Oracle ADW.
